This directory contains the files needed to control the CPU temperature of the 
RaspberryPi 4B using the smart the Smart Cooling Hat (DF-DFR0672).

To build the executable run the following command:

	gcc -o tempcontrol tempcontrol.c ssd1306_i2c.c -lwiringPi

Then copy tempcontrol executable to 	/usr/local/bin

and copy runtempcontrol.sh script to 	/usr/local/bin

Finally, add the following line to /etc/rc.local:

	/usr/bin/local/runtempcontrol.sh&

This will start the tempcontrol executable and restart if if it terminates
prematurely.
